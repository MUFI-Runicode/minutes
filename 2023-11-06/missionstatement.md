# Mission statement MUFI Runicode

## Guidelines for the digital encoding of runic characters

The purpose of the MUFI Runicode sub-panel is to establish common guidelines for the interoperable digital encoding of runic characters for runological and philological purposes, focusing on use in:

1. databases (relational, graph, etc)
2. text-based document encoding (Plain text, HTML, XML, etc)
3. digital and print publication (LaTEX, Word, PDF, etc)
4. non-visual/screen-reader accessibility applications

These applications cover the common use areas of digital corpora, databases of inscriptions for search and analysis, and digital documents for output.

- The guidelines should build upon the existing Unicode Runic range.
- The guidelines should be made with a view to possible future standardisation.
- The guidelines should include an encoding standard capable of supporting both linguistic and graphemic analyses:
	- Due to the nature of the runic script and specifically its many local and time-variable variations, while being used to write down language, it is important that any encoding standard for runes be capable of mirroring the two levels of analysis that matter to runologists, namely: the purely visual or graphemic, and the linguistic, where form and shape of single rune is for the most part irrelevant.
	- Thus the guidelines should, as far as possible, allow for runes to be encoded as – plain text – at both the grapheme and glyph level, but for that distinction to be elided when necessary for the purposes of search, analysis, display, etc.
- The guidelines should aim to document primary and secondary provenance information for the runic characters and forms encoded.
- While runic fonts and typefaces are not the primary focus of the guidelines, the guidelines should take into account the requirements of runological typesetting in their formulation, and some font work may be required in parallel for demonstration and display purposes.

## Guidelines for the digital encoding of runic forms

In addition, the sub-panel should also establish separate guidelines for the digital encoding of runic forms.

- The guidelines should encode runic forms only, with no implied linguistic content.
- The guidelines should be considered orthogonal to those for the encoding of runic characters.
- The guidelines should not define mappings of visual forms to characters, but empirical relationships may be recorded as part of the process of collecting visual forms.
